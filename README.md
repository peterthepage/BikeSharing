# BikeSharing
## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to prove the viablility of starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines. Based on how the Citi Bikes work in New York, specifically Manhattan, we can get an idea of how they would be used in Des Moines.
## Results
* It appears that the most common use for the bikes are quick, 10-20 minute commutes. !(https://github.com/peterthepage/BikeSharing/blob/main/Worksheets/1.PNG)
* This holds true no matter the gender of the customer. !(https://github.com/peterthepage/BikeSharing/blob/main/Worksheets/2.PNG)
* We can assume that for the most part the bikes are being used for commuting because of the times that they are checked out the most. Meaning 8am and after 5pm. !(https://github.com/peterthepage/BikeSharing/blob/main/Worksheets/3.PNG)
* Seeing as the male version of this graph is basically the same, men are absolutely using the Citi Bikes for commuting by and large. !(https://github.com/peterthepage/BikeSharing/blob/main/Worksheets/4.PNG)
* If bike maintenance needs to happen during the weekdays Wednesday will be the day with the best opportunity to do it based on the fewer bikes used. !(https://github.com/peterthepage/BikeSharing/blob/main/Worksheets/5.PNG)
* Further reinforcing the theory that these bikes are used mostly for commutes is the fact that the most used start and end stations are in the same basic area in Manhattan.
